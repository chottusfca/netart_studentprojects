                    <p>do you awake and remember the time you’ve spent in my mind?</p>
                    <p>every sunrise i think of you. 
                      your softness leaves a space in my diaphragm that i can only describe as an internal hug.</p>
                      <p>every new memory that’s formed is a comparison to the ones you gave me. as low, disgusting, sick, corrupt you are, 
                      <p>i see myself in you.</p>
                      <p>because we both crave change.</p>
                      <p>we both fixate on a constant self-improvement journey where the goal is embody earthly perfection. 
                      we once ran away from our darkness together.</p>
                      <p>i now swim alone in my darkness and create my own light. an auric glow around my being, blessed with the pure energy of love and beauty.</p>
                      <p>that’s why i love you so.</p>
                      <p>you’re beautiful. you want to change. you avoid your insecurities. and i once was the same.</p>
                      <p>i wonder if i return, it will bring me back to the person i once was.</p>
                      <p>are we good for each other? can i learn more from you or is our course over?</p>
                      <p>for now, i’ll think.</p>
                      <p>i'll keep you in my head and in my heart for a while longer. and as i continue to grow into my own power, i’ll watch what you do with yours.

                  <p class="post-description">The title, “4 Morant” indicates that she's stuck in the past feeling an overwhelming sense of guilt for believing she could have been happy and in love. She had wanted to live and move on from her breakup and all her past mistakes but is now stuck living in the past and unable to heal. She’s lost all motivation for change, falling deeper and deeper into her depressive state. She sees it as “it is what it is” saying “better luck next time” as to mean in another life maybe she could start over, however she’s too far gone. Doja can no longer truly live, and is now forced to relive the same hurtful and traumatic moments of her life over and over again, hence the “I’ve been moving in backward directions during astral projection” and “don’t mess with the past tense” lines.</p>

    <h2>this is the worst day right now</h2>
    <p>the difference between now and when i was younger is that now i really have the courage to do it. this taks more courage and strength than people think. if i were weak like others say, i would just stay down. i'm brave enough to end it. twice this year. both now and then i've really wanted to do this. everything looks and feels so ugly. i'm so tired. i can't keep doing this. i'm so manic right now. i'm on shrooms but this feeling has been festering since this morning. there are so many evil and horrible feelings in this world and i feel each and every single one of them in this moment right now and im so tired if it. i've needed help for so long and the only reason i'm trying to write neatly right now is so my future self can read it well. that's so sweet of me but i can't imagine a future self. she seems fake because why would i ever be that happy. i feel like i'm 16 again but this time i'm braver. if she got through it then so can i but do i even want to?</p>
