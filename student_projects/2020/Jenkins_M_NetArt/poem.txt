SPRING

saturday morning
	sunlight
	music
	pastries
	love

the water is cold but the car is warm
	i ran around in the waves and dug my toes into the sand
	you wrapped a towel around me
	dried my hair
	you were always warm

kite
	endless expanse of grass and sky
	the bay, the forest
	i could run forever

SUMMER

uncertainty
	you dislike something about her eyes
	you dislike something about her face
	does it matter then
	that i am half of her?

one day
	i think you loved me once
	you held me tightly
	you always smiled
	but now
	i'm not sure

AUTUMN

it's like i killed you myself
	you wanted to fly free forever
	but i chained you down
	you wanted to surf the endless ocean
	but i held you back
	you wanted to see the world
	but your eyes had to watch me
	you hid it well
	i almost never realized
	almost

are you going to look at me?
	i know the abyss has settled in your eyes
	i haven't looked into them for a long time
	but i know that if i did 
	i would find nothing looking back at me

ghost
	you're alive
	but barely
	you move
	but wretchedly
	you speak
	but painfully
	you're someone in my life
	but not anymore

WINTER

i latch the door when i think of you
	i latch the door when i think of the time
	that my mother screamed
	that she pleaded
	when i thought i was next
	when you ran
	i latch the door

contradiction
	i long to be held in your arms
	i screamed and cried when you came near
	i am haunted by your love
	i banged on the door and yelled
	i want to see your face
	i am terrified of what i might find
	i yearn for what was
	i scorn what is

now i mostly just grow basil
	you watered the plant too much and kept it in the dark
	it's grown mold; the dirt covered by white round lumps
	it's unrecognizable; i cannot see underneath; the dark earth is gone
	neglected, water poured, darkness enshrouded
	the bird does not sing
	but now i mostly just grow basil
